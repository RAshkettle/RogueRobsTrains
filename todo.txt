//- it's far too easy to lure enemies into melee; what if enemies (aware of player - it should be check if enemy saw player entering other room) would shoot through doors / curtains, with accuracy penalty?
- choose size of font
- choose animation speed
- weapons should differ more (done for pistols and melee weapons) (weaker repeaters?)
//- weapons should not stack (just spawn them on the nearest empty tile - like in Kornel's games)
//- ai?
//- in limited ammo mode, automatically pick up ammo from dead enemies
//- enemies should have limited ammo in limited ammo mode :P
//- auto-aim works through windows
- show enemies weapons (in messages, through inspecting, etc)
- Remingtons' curves are reversed, it seems (not! only remingtons)
- looking should use [tab] as well
- change all these "NAME cocks weapon" "NAME misses", "NAME dies" etc with "You hear cocking", "You hear scream!" etc if source is out of fov
