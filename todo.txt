- it's far too easy to lure enemies into melee; what if enemies (aware of player - it should be check if enemy saw player entering other room) would shoot through doors / curtains, with accuracy penalty?
- choose size of font
- weapons should differ more (done for pistols and melee weapons)
- weapons should not stack (just spawn them on the nearest empty tile - like in Kornel's games)
- ai?
- in limited ammo mode, automaticall ypick up ammo from dead enemies
- enemies shpuld have limited ammo in limited ammo mode :P
- auto-aim works through windows
- show enemies weapons (in messages, through inspecting, etc)
- range indicator for targetting as well
- so... when dying, one could drop cocked weapon; player can swap rifles even having revolver in hand; so, it's possible to pick up and have cocked rifle while having cocked colt as well; workaround: swapping weapon should change active weapon as well
- Remingtons' curves are reversed, it seems (only remingtons?)
